	 <P>This API allows you to select a device.

	 <BR>
	 All input variables are

	 include: %A, %E, %H, %X, and %Y.
	 <BR>
	 <BR>
	 If device selection is successful,
	 characteristics of the output device are returned in a number of different
	 variables. If selection is unsuccessful, ^%ZIS returns the POP output 
     variable with a positive number. So, checks for an unsuccessful device selection should
	 be based on the POP input variable as a positive number.
	 <BR>
	 <BR>
	 Device selection can be done as shown in the example that follows.

		   <P>(optional) The %ZIS input variable is defined as a string

		       M&#151;RIGHT MARGIN: The user will be prompted with the right margin query.
			   <BR>

			 <LI>
			   N&#151;NO OPENING: The Device Handler will return the

			   the device prompt.
			   <BR>
			   <BR>
			 </LI>
			 <LI>
			   Q&#151;QUEUING ALLOWED: The job can be queued to run at later. There is no automatic link between the Device Handler and the TaskMan. If
			   queuing is allowed, just before the Device Handler is called, the application
			   routine must set the %ZIS variable to a string that includes the letter
			   "Q". For example:
			   <PRE>  &gt;<B>S %ZIS="MQ" D ^%ZIS</B></PRE>If the user selects queuing, the Device Handler will define
			   the IO("Q") variable as an output variable, to indicate that queuing
			   was selected. If queuing is selected, the application should set the needed
			   TaskMan variables and call the TaskMan interface routine ^%ZTLOAD.
			   <BR>
			   <BR>
			   <b>NOTE:</b> For further details on how to call the TaskMan interface, please refer to the "TaskMan: Programmer Tools" chapter in the
			   <I>Kernel Developer's Guide</I>.

			 </LI>
			 <LI>
			   0&#151;DON'T USE IO(0): The Device Handler will not attempt to
			   use IO(0), the home device at the time of the call to ^%ZIS.
			   <BR>
			   <BR>
			 </LI>
			 <LI>
			   D&#151;DIRECT PRINTING: If the selected device is unavailable, it 
				returns a positive number in POP.
			   <BR>
			   <BR>
			 </LI>
			 <LI>
			   L&#151;RESET IO("ZIO"): If %ZIS contains L, the IO("ZIO")
			   output variable will be reset with the static physical port name (e.g., the

		   On some M systems, Right Margin is an OPEN

		  will not be displayed or selectable. Like comparable VA FileMan screens,

          variables like ION or IOT. As with VA FileMan, the variable "Y" can be used in
		  the screen to refer to the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the device. Also, the
		  M naked indicator is at the global level ^%ZIS(1,Y,0). An example to limit
		  device selection to spool device types (SPL) only might be coded as follows:</P>

		  <P>(optional) Use the IOP variable to specify the output device. There is no user
		  interaction when IOP is defined to specify an output device; the device name
	      (.01 field) is the usual value of IOP. You can also set IOP to Q and P. (The
		  value of IOP must not be $I).
		  <BR>
		  <BR>
		  You can request queuing by setting
		  IOP="Q". The user is then asked to specify a device for queuing. To pre-select
		  the device, set IOP="Q;device"; the device specified after the semicolon is
		  selected and IO("Q") is set.
		  <BR>
		  <BR>
		  You can request the closest printer, as
		  specified in the DEVICE file (#3.5), by setting IOP="P" or IOP="p". If there is
		  not a closest printer associated with the home device at the time of the call,
		  device selection fails and POP is returned with a positive value.
		  <BR>
		  <BR>
		  You can now also pass the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the desired device through
		  IOP. For instance, to select a device with an IEN of 202, you can set 
          IOP to an accent grave character followed by the IEN value of 202 before the call to
		  ^%ZIS. The following example illustrates the above call:</P>
		  <PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP="`202" D ^%ZIS</B></PRE>
		  <P>Using the IEN rather than device name can be useful when
		  applications have the desired device stored as a pointer to the DEVICE file
		  (#3.5) rather than as FREE TEXT.</P>

            </li>
			<li>
			  The third situation arises when a device is identified but is unknown to the system.

          <P>The first condition of no device selection will be met if the

          Exceeding the TIMED READ at the right margin or address/parameters 
          prompts will have the same result.</P>
          <P>The second condition, unavailability, is met if the Device 
          Handler cannot open the selected device. The selected 
          device may also have existed on another computer but queuing was 
          not requested or perhaps not permitted (%ZIS had not contained Q).</P>
          <P>Finally, the selected device may not exist in the DEVICE file

	<H4>Example 2</H4> 
	<P>The IOP variable can be defined to pass a string to the Device
	Handler so that no user interaction will be required for device selection
	information. The following is the general format for defining IOP:</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP=[Q[;]][DEVICE NAME][;SUBTYPE][;SPOOL DOCUMENT NAME][;RIGHT MARGIN[;PAGE LENGTH]]</B></PRE> 
	<H4>Example 3</H4> 
	<P>If the SPOOL DOCUMENT NAME is included, then the RIGHT MARGIN and PAGE
	LENGTH are ignored. Therefore, use the following format if a spool device is
	desired:</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP=[Q[;]][DEVICE NAME][;SUBTYPE][;SPOOL DOCUMENT NAME]</B></PRE> 
	<H4>Example 4</H4> 
	<P>The following shows how a device named "RXPRINTER" in the DEVICE file
	(#3.5) can be opened <I>without user interaction</I>:</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP="RXPRINTER" D ^%ZIS Q:POP</B></PRE>
	<H4>Example 5</H4> 
	<P>When setting the IOP variable, you can include the right
	margin:</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP=ION_";"_IOM  or  S IOP=";120"</B></PRE>
	<P>or</P>
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP="RXPRINTER;120"</B></PRE>
	<P>In this example, ION is the local variable that contains the name
	of the device to be opened and the IOM variable contains the value of
	the desired right margin.</P>
	<H4>Example 6</H4> 
	<P>The IOP variable can be set to force queuing by starting the
	string with "Q":</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>SET IOP="Q;"_ION_";"_IOM  ... etc.</B></PRE>
	<P>In order to force queuing and prompt the user for a device:</P>
	<PRE>&gt;<B>SET IOP="Q" D ^%ZIS Q:POP</B></PRE>
	<H4>Example 7</H4> 
	<P>A <I>spool document name</I> can be passed to the Device Handler:</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP=DEVNAM_";"_IO("DOC") D ^%ZIS Q:POP</B></PRE>
	<P>or</P>
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP="SPOOL;"_IO("DOC")</B></PRE>
	<P>or</P>
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP=DEVNAM_";"_IOST_";"_IO("DOC")</B></PRE>
	<P>or</P>
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP="SPOOL;P-OTHER;MYDOC"</B></PRE>
	<P>NOTE: For more information, please refer to the "Spooling" chapter in
	the <I>Kernel Systems Manual</I>.</P>
	<P>In this example, DEVNAM contains the name of the device to be opened.
	IO("DOC") contains the spool document name, and IOST contains the name of the
	desired subtype. "SPOOL" is the actual name of a device entry that corresponds
	to the spool device, "P-OTHER" is the desired subtype, and "MYDOC" is the name
	of the spool document.</P>
	<H4>Example 8</H4> 
	<P>Finally, the IOP variable can be used to select a device by the
	device's Internal Entry Number (IEN). To select a device with an IEN of 202,
	set IOP to an accent grave character followed by the IEN value of 202:</P> 
	<PRE>&gt;<B>S IOP="`202" D ^%ZIS</B></PRE>
	<H4>Multiple Devices and ^%ZIS</H4> 
	<P>Beyond the home device, the ^%ZIS API is not designed to open more than
	one additional device at a time.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	For interactive users, the home device
	should already be open and defined in the Kernel environment. ^%ZIS should only
	be used to open one additional device at a time for interactive users. For a
	task, you can use ^%ZIS to open one additional device beyond the task's
	assigned device.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Beginning with Kernel V. 8.0, there are three APIs to
	support using more than one additional device simultaneously:</P>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    OPEN^%ZISUTL(): Open Device with Handle
		<BR>
		<BR>
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    USE^%ZISUTL(): Use Device Given a Handle
		<BR>
		<BR>
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    CLOSE^%ZISUTL(): Close Device with Handle
	  </LI>
	</UL>
	<P>These "multiple device" APIs are described later in this chapter.</P>
	<H4>Host Files and ^%ZIS</H4> 
	<P>Although it is possible to use the ^%ZIS API to manipulate Host files,
	the Host file API (in ^%ZISH) offers more robust Host file
	functionality.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>NOTE:</b> For more information on using the Host file API,
	please refer to the "Host Files" chapter in the <I>Kernel Developer's guide</I>.</P>
