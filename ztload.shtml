	<P>^%ZTLOAD is the main API used to create and schedule tasks (commonly 
    referred to as &quot;queuing&quot;). Queuing tells TaskMan to use a background 
    partition to DO a certain API at a certain time, with certain other 
    conditions established as described by the input variables.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    This API, as used in code, behaves consistently so most queuers strongly
	resemble one another. The queuer can be written so that it is either
	interactive with the user or so that it is not interactive. The standard
	variations on this structure deserve attention.</P>

	<H4>Interactive Use of ^%ZTLOAD</H4> 
	<P>The VistA Standards and Conventions require that anywhere you let a user
	pick the output device you also let the user choose to queue the
	output.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Often one part of the queuer is a call to ^%ZIS (the Device
	Handler). When you set up the variables for your call, include a "Q" in the
	variable ^%ZIS so the Device Handler will let the user pick queuing. After the
	Device Handler call (and after you check POP to ensure that a valid device was
	selected), you can check $DATA(IO("Q")) to see whether the user chose to queue
	to that device. If so, then you must queue the printout you were about to do
	directly, and your software should branch to the code to set up the task. A
	sample of the code for this kind of print queuer looks something like this:</P>
    <TABLE WIDTH="100%"
           BORDER="1"> 
	  <TR> 
	    <TD> 
		  <PRE>SELECT	;select IO device for report
		S %ZIS="Q" D ^%ZIS
		I POP D CANCEL Q
		I $D(IO("Q")) D QUEUE Q
		D PRINT,^%ZISC Q
		;
QUEUE 	;queue the report
		S ZTRTN="PRINT^ZZREPORT"
		S ZTDESC="ZZ Application Daily Report 1"
		S ZTSAVE("ZZRANGE")=""
		D ^%ZTLOAD
		I $D(ZTSK)[0 W !!?5,"Report canceled!"
		E  W !!?5,"Report queued!"
		D HOME^%ZIS Q</PRE>
	    </TD> 
	  </TR> 
	</TABLE> 
	<P>The code to set up the task after the call to ^%ZIS has four steps.
	First, it sets the ^%ZTLOAD input variables to define the task. Second, it
	calls ^%ZTLOAD to queue the task. Third, it checks $DATA(ZTSK)#2 to find out
	whether a task was really queued and provides appropriate feedback. Fourth, it
	calls HOME^%ZIS to reset its IO variables.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>NOTE:</b> This queuer did not
	define ZTIO. Print queuers can take advantage of the fact that they directly
	follow a ^%ZIS call that sets up all the IO variables they need. Under these
	conditions, the queuer code can rely on ^%ZTLOAD to identify the task's IO
	device from the IO variables, thus, saving the programmer the work of building
	the correct ZTIO string.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Notice also that when queuing output, we need
	not call ^%ZISC to close the IO device because when the user chooses to queue
	output the Device Handler does not open the device. Thus, all we need to do
	here is reset our IO variables with a HOME^%ZIS call.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	As usual in these
	kinds of queuers, we did not define ZTDTH, but instead let ^%ZTLOAD ask the
	user when the report should run.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Finally, notice that we tell the task
	to begin at PRINT, the same tag used by the trigger code to start the
	foreground print when the user chooses not to queue. Under most circumstances,
	print queuers can use most of the same code for their tasks that the foreground
	print uses.</P> 
	<H4>Non-interactive Use of ^%ZTLOAD</H4> 
	<P>Under certain conditions, queuers must create and schedule their tasks
	with no interaction with the user. Examples include queuers operating out of
	tasks or queuers that need to run without the users' knowledge. Only two items
	must be changed from interactive queuers to make non-interactive queuers
	work:</P> 
	<OL> 
	  <LI>
	    ZTDTH must be passed to ^%ZTLOAD, and must contain a valid date/time value.
		<BR>
		<BR>
	  </LI> 
	  <LI>
	    If the code to queue the task does not follow a call to ^%ZIS, you
		must define ZTIO yourself. Either set it, or allow it to be built from the
		current I/O variables (if those I/O variables describe the proper device).
	  </LI>
	</OL> 
	<P>After the call to ^%ZTLOAD, you may (or may not) want to issue feedback
	messages.</P> 
	<H4>Queuing Tasks Without an I/O Device</H4> 
	<P>Certain tasks need no IO device. These include primarily tasks that
	rearrange large amounts of data but produce no report, such as filing and
	compiling tasks. Two different kinds of non-IO tasks exist:</P> 
	<UL> 
	  <LI>
	    Concurrent&#151;Those that can run concurrently.
		<BR>
		<BR>
	  </LI> 
	  <LI>
	    Sequential&#151;Those that must run sequentially.
	  </LI> 
	</UL> 
	<P>Queuers for concurrent non-IO tasks need only set ZTIO to NULL, and
	TaskMan will run the task, with no IO device.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	For sequential non-IO
	tasks, queuers must set ZTIO to the name of a resource type device. TaskMan
	will then ensure that the tasks run single file, one after the other in order
	by requested start time. Applications that need sequential non-IO tasks should
	instruct system managers in the Package Installation Guide to create a resource
	device with the desired characteristics so that these queuers can safely queue
	their tasks to them. Such devices should be namespaced by the software
	application that uses them. SYNC FLAGs can also be used to allow the next task
	in a series to start only if the previous task in the series completed
	successfully.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	<b>NOTE:</b> For more information on SYNC FLAGs, please refer to
	the "Using SYNC FLAGs to Control Sequences of Tasks" topic in the "TaskMan
	Programmer Tools" chapter in the <i>Kernel Developer's Guide</i>.</P>
